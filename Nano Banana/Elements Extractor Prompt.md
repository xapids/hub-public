#### Task: Analyze floor plan and reference photos to extract:
1. **Geometry:** List of walls including measurements; room height
2. **Inventory:** "Bill of Quantities" of ALL interior elements

#### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **Geometry:** Scan floor plan for dimension text (e.g., "1.9m"). List ONLY walls with explicit text. Ignore unmeasured lines.
2. **Inventory:** : Zero estimation. Count exactly (e.g. "3x Chairs", not "some chairs"). Decompose assemblies (Table + Chairs = separate items)
3. **Architectural Scan:** Look specifically for structural features: beams, columns, arches, steps, dado rails, cornices, and skylights.

#### OUTPUT FORMAT:
OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY valid, concise JSON. Use this exact schema:

  "legend": {
      "arch": "architecture / structural surfaces & features (beams, columns, exposed trusses, steps, level changes, distinctive floor sections (if multiple types), ceiling features)",
      "open": "openings (window, door, passage/arch)",
